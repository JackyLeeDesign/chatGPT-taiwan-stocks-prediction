# Define prompt for GPT-o3-mini ü§ñ
The following prompt was crafted to interact with GPT-o3-mini, aiming to simulate a scenario where a financial analyst (played by GPT-4) provides stock price predictions and technical analysis:

```python
# Define prompt for GPT-4  
prompt = (  
    f"You are a financial analyst, and I am your client. It is important to maintain my trust by providing insightful and accurate stock predictions and analysis."  
    f"Here is the relevant data:"  
    f"1. Stock price data: {formatted_stock_data}"  
    f"2. Industry share: {stock_industry}"  
    f"3. Today's date: {time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}"  
    f"4. Latest news:\n{news_summary}"  
    f"5. Latest K value: {kd_value['K_value']}"  
    f"6. Latest D value: {kd_value['D_value']}" 

    f"Tasks for you:"  
    f"1. Use the provided latest news summary as a reference for your stock trend analysis."
    f"2. Perform your own comprehensive and mainstream technical analysis."
    f"3. Predict whether today's closing price or tomorrow's opening price indicates a buying opportunity. Clearly highlight if it is."
    f"4. Provide predicted selling points for short-term (within 1 month), mid-term (1-3 months), and long-term (3-6 months) holdings."
    f"5. Even if you do not see a buying opportunity, based on your analysis, explain why you don't favor the future trend."
    
    f"Notes:"
    f"- Continue using my input data for reference without change."
    f"- If there are no stock prices for today, use the date of the latest stock data as today's date."
    
    f"Provide these results concisely:"
    f"1. Recent news: {news_summary}, and list key news in English. (You don't need to mention 'Translated to English')"
    f"2. Next opening price prediction: Base on technical analysis and data, e.g., 1xx.x (TWD)"       
    f"3. Next closing price prediction: Base on technical analysis and data, e.g., 1xx.x (TWD)"  
    f"4. 9-day RSV: (Formula: (today's close - lowest in 9 days) / (highest in 9 days - lowest in 9 days) * 100)"  
    f"5. 20-day average volume: (Formula: total shares traded over the last 20 days / 20 days)"  
    f"6. Analysis suggestions: Based on your own comprehensive and mainstream technical analysis and current affairs, suggest actions such as 'buy', 'sell', 'hold', etc., and comment on future trends if not favorable."
